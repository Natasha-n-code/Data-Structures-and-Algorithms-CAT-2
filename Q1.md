Question 1: Big O Notation Rules in Algorithm Analysis

Big O notation specifies the upper limit of the time or space complexity of an algorithm. It is a way of describing the growth of an algorithm's running time or memory usage as a function of the size of the input, by comparing it to the growth of a simpler function.


Some of the rules that must be used are:

Ignore Constants:

Constants are ignored as they do not affect the growth rate of an algorithm with regards to an increase in input size.

e.g.: O (34n) simplifies to O (n) and the reason being that the constant (34), is ignored.

1. Consider the Dominant Term:

The term with the highest growth rate is considered

e.g.: O (2n3 + n2 + 1) simplifies to a complexity of O(n3) because 3 is the highest growth rate here

2.	Different Inputs, Different Variables:

Use different variables to represent multiple inputs in an algorithm

Example: O (n + i) where ‘n’ and ‘i’ are two different input sizes.

3.	Additive vs. Multiplicative Complexity:

o	Additive: When steps are sequential, add their complexities.

Example: O (n) + O(m) becomes O (n + m).

o	Multiplicative: When steps are nested, multiply their complexities.

Example: O (n) * O(m) becomes O (n * m).

This just makes things easier and reduces redundancy.

4. Best, Average, and Worst Case:

Big O is normally used to represent the worst-case scenario, but it can be used for both average or best-case analysis.
