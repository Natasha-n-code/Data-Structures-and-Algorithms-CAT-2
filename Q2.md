1. Memory allocation
Arrays store memory adjacently, which makes access fast.
Linked lists use non-contiguous memory blocks where nodes use pointers to connect to each other.

2. Performance
Because elements can be directly accessed by their index, arrays provide faster access.
With linked lists, reaching a specific node needs transversal with makes the access process longer.

3. Insertion and deletion
Insertion and Deletion Operations:

Arrays:

Insertion/Deletion at the end is O(1) if space is available.

Insertion/Deletion in the middle is O(n) because elements need to be shifted.

Insertion/Deletion at the beginning is O(n) because all elements need to be shifted.

Linked Lists:

Insertion/Deletion at the beginning is O(1) because only the head pointer needs to be changed.

Insertion/Deletion in the middle is O(n) because traversal needs to be done to find the node.

Insertion/Deletion at the end is O(n) because traversal to the end node is involved.
